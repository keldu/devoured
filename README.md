# devoured
A wrapper around the terraria binary. Terraria makes administration a little bit difficult with some strange behaviour.  
I want to write a service which accepts custom commands like this one  
`devoured -t terraria -c "motd This is the message of the day" `  
Currently not working, but the general layout is done. Just have to write a proper management socket for devoured.
